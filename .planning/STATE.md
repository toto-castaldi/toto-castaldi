## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full log.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- v1.1: Stay with plain CSS (no SCSS migration) -- under 500 lines, custom properties sufficient
- v1.1: Keep checkbox-hack dark mode toggle -- 100% browser support, already working
- v1.1: Fix contrast tokens before any visual work -- prerequisite for all bento styling

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Light mode border contrast at 1.24:1 (needs 3:1) -- Phase 4 will fix
- Dark mode border contrast at 1.72:1 (needs 3:1) -- Phase 4 will fix
- Template restructure risks breaking dark mode toggle sibling selector -- Phase 5 risk
