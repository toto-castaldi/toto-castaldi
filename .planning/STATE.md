## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure -- infrastructure first, then full bilingual site, then SEO polish
- [Roadmap]: defaultContentLanguageInSubdir must be decided in Phase 1 before any content exists

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 Day 0 decisions (baseURL, defaultContentLanguageInSubdir, CNAME, DNS order) cannot be changed cheaply later -- see research/PITFALLS.md
- Exact project descriptions for Docora, Lumio, Helix in IT and EN needed before Phase 2 completes
- Typography decision (system fonts vs. specific typeface) should be made before Phase 2
