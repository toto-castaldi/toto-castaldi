# toto-castaldi.com

## What This Is

A minimal, multilingual (Italian/English) landing page that showcases Toto Castaldi's public software projects. Built with Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages at toto-castaldi.com and www.toto-castaldi.com.

## Core Value

Visitors can immediately see what projects exist and navigate to each one — in their preferred language.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Multilingual landing page (IT/EN) generated with Hugo
- [ ] Each project displayed with name, short description, and link
- [ ] Three projects: Docora, Lumio, Helix with their subdomain URLs
- [ ] Minimal clean design with strong typography
- [ ] Hosted on GitHub Pages with custom domain (toto-castaldi.com + www)
- [ ] Language switcher between Italian and English

### Out of Scope

- About/bio section — not needed, focus on projects only
- Contact form or social links — keep it minimal
- Blog or dynamic content — static landing page only
- Mobile app — web only

## Context

- Domain already owned: toto-castaldi.com
- Three existing projects live on subdomains:
  - Docora: https://docora.toto-castaldi.com/
  - Lumio: https://lumio.toto-castaldi.com/
  - Helix: https://helix.toto-castaldi.com/
- GitHub Pages chosen for hosting (free, simple CI/CD with GitHub Actions)
- Hugo chosen as static site generator (fast, good i18n support)

## Constraints

- **Stack**: Hugo static site generator — user preference
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages — free, integrated with repo
- **Languages**: Italian and English — both required from day one
- **Design**: Minimal and clean — whitespace-heavy, strong typography, little color

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Hugo over alternatives | User preference, excellent i18n support, fast builds | — Pending |
| GitHub Pages hosting | Free, simple deploy from repo, custom domain support | — Pending |
| No about/contact sections | User wants focus on projects only | — Pending |
